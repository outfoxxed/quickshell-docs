We recommend you read the [QML Overview](./qml-overview) to get an overview of
the QML language first.

There is a list of every Qt and quickshell type in the [Type Reference](/docs/types)
along with all of their properties.

The [quickshell-examples](https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/quickshell-examples) repo contains
fully working example configurations you can read and modify.
